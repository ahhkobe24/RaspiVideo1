# WEBCAM Built on the Raspberry Pi

This project is to install operating system on Raspberry Pi, then using mjpg-streamer service to build a WebCam on the device.

MJPG-streamer is acting as an
adhesive to bond single input-plugin and much output-plugin, and almost all works are done by those plugins.

Then build a app to recieve the video from the Raspberry Pi.

These code is mainly about the Android App part.
